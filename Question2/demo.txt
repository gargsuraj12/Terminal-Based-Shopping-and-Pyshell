ter using Python: Select Interpreter, that interpreter is applied when right-clicking a 
file and selecting Python: Run Python File in Terminal. 
You can also use Terminal: Create New Integrated Terminal or Python:
 Create Terminal to open a terminal in which that environment is activated. 
 (The python.terminal.activateEnvironment setting, set to true by default,
  controls automatic activation.)

However, launching VS Code from a shell in which a certain Python environment is activated does
 not automatically activate that environment in the default Terminal. Use the Terminal: 
 Create New Integrated Terminal or Python: Create Terminal command after VS Code is running.

Any changes you make to an activated environment within the terminal are persistent. 
For example, using conda install <package> from the terminal with a conda environment activated 
installs the package into that environment permanently. Similarly, using pip install in a terminal 
with a virtual environment activated adds the package to that environment.
